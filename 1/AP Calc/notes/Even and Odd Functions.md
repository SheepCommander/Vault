A function $f$ is **even** if for all $x$ in its domain,
> $f(-x) = f(x)$.

A function $f$ is **odd** if for all $x$ in its domain,
$f(-x) = -f(x)$.

# How to tell
$f(x)=x^2+1$  is even!
> exponents of x are 2 and 0, both even! 

$f(x)=x^3+x$ is odd!
> exponents of x are 3 and 1, both odd!

$f(x)=x^2+x$ is **not odd or even**.
> bc exponents of x are 2 and 1 â€” they need to be all even or odd!!

Even is like a parabola (Symmetrical over the y-axis!)

Odd is like a cubic (rotated 180 around origin) (Symmetrical over either y=x or y=-x)
