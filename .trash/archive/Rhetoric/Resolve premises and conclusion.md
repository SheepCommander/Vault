#Rhetoric 
# Resolve premises and conclusion
The very first step in making an argument is to ask yourself what you are trying to prove. What is your conclusion? Remember that the conclusion is the statement for which you are giving reasons. The statements that give your reasons are your *premises*.
$\qquad$Let's say that you want to persuade your friends (or children, or parents, or ...) to eat more beans. Probably this does not seem like the world's most promising proposition, or the most important one either. But it is a good first illustration—and diet does matter! Let's consider how you might make such an argument.
$\qquad$You have your conclusion: we should eat beans. That is your belief. But why? What are your *reasons*? You may need to state them for yourself, for clarity first of all, and then to check that they really are *good* reasons. Certainly you have to state good reasons clearly if you expect others to agree or to change how they eat.
$\qquad$So again: What *are* your reasons? One main premise probably is that beans are health: higher in fibers and protein and lower in fat and cholesterol than what most people eat now. So, properly supplemented, a diet of more beans could lead to a longer and more active life. You may not want to assume that your friends or family have heard, or really appreciated, this reason before—at least it is useful to be reminded.
$\qquad$To get people motivated, it would be useful to add another main premise as well. Since beans are often stereotyped as boring, why not also argue that bean dishes actually can be varied and exciting? Give some examples, your own favorite bean dishes maybe: spicy black bean taco fillings, for instance, and hummus (made from garbanzo beans). Now you've got an argument—good solid reasons for a clear conclusion.
$\qquad$Even jokes can be arguments, though the reasons may seem silly.
> Living on earth may be tough, but it includes a free ride around the sun every year.[^1]

Getting a free ride around the sun is not the sort of reason you normally expect for bearing up when life gets tough. But it is still a reason: an attempt to justify the claim that life isn't quite so bas as it may sometimes seem. It's a funny *argument*.
$\qquad$In Rule 1—*Resolves* premises and conclusion—the word "resolve" has two related meanings. The first is to *distinguish* them. Your reasons are different from your conclusion: keep them clearly separate. Getting a free ride around the sun is a distinct idea from bearing up when life gets tough, and it logically comes first. It's a premise. Being better able to bear up might be something that follows. It's a conclusion.
$\qquad$Once you have distinguished your premises and conclusion, be sure that both are claims you want to *commit* to. This is the other meaning of "resolve." If so, proceed. If not, change them! In any case, being clear to yourself is necessary before you can be clear to anyone else.
$\qquad$This book offers you a ready list of different forms that arguments can take. Use this list to develop your premises. To defend a generalization, for instance, check [Chapter II](_Workbook.md#Chapter%20II%20Arguments%20by%20Example II Arguments by Example>). It will remind you that you need to give a series of examples as premises, and it will tell you what sort of examples to look for. If your conclusion requires a deductive argument like those explained in [Chapter VI](_Workbook.md#Chapter%20VI%20Deductive%20Arguments VI Deductive Arguments>), the rules outlined in that chapter will tell you what types of premises you need. You may have to try several different arguments before you find one that works well.

# Exercise Set 1.1: Distinguishing premises from conclusions
**Objective:** To give you practice distinguishing premises from conclusions in other people's arguments.

**Instructions:** Rewrite each argument below, underlining the conclusion of each argument and putting brackets around each premise.

**Tips for success:** Distinguishing premises from conclusions is sometimes more of an art than a science. We wish people were always clear about the premises and conclusions of their argument, but that's just not the case.
Therefore, learning to distinguish between premises from conclusions takes practice. As you practice, there are two strategies that you should keep in mind.
$\qquad$The first strategy is simply to ask yourself what the author of this argument is trying to convince you to believe. The claim that the author is trying to get you to believe is the arguments' conclusion. Then you can ask what *reasons* the author gives to try to convince you. These will be the argument's premises.
$\qquad$The second strategy for distinguishing premises from conclusions is to look for *indicator words*. Some words or phrases are *conclusion indicators*. These are words or phrases that tell you that you're about to read or hear the conclusion of an argument. Other words are *premise indicators*. These tell you that you're about to read or hear a premise. Here's a sample of the most common conclusion and premise indicators:

Conclusion Indicators                                               | Premise Indicators 
------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
therefore<br>thus<br>hence<br>so<br>consequently<br>this shows that | because<br>since<br>given that<br>for<br>on the grounds that<br>this follows from |
You'll start to notice more indicator words as you get better at analyzing arguments.
$\qquad$Two more pieces of advice: First, don't rely solely on indicator words. Some arguments will not use any indicator words. Others will use indicator words in other ways. Some words, like *because, since,* and *so*, have many other uses; not every use of *because* indicates you're about to hear a premise. When in doubt, fall back on our first strategy: ask yourself whether the author is giving you a reason for the conclusion. If your answer is no, you haven't found a premise, even if the sentence includes *because*or *since*.
$\qquad$==Second, don't assume that everything in a passage is either a premise or a conclusion.== Not all passages contain arguments. Some passages are telling stories, describing things, giving explanations, issuing commands, making jokes, or doing other things besides giving reasons for a conclusion. Even in passages that do contain arguments, some sentences or clauses will provide background information, make side comments, and so on. Again, the key is to ask yourself, "Is this sentence stating a conclusion or giving me a reason to believe that conclusion?" If it is doing either, it's part of an argument; if not, it's not.

> [!NOTE] KEEP THE HIGHLIGHTED PART IN MIND!
> When the class was doing the below exercises, the massive mistake EVERYONE made was underlining and bracketing TOO MUCH of the passages. **Only bracket the actual premise of the sentence, not the entire thing!**

### Sample

> \[In order to prosper, a democracy needs its citizens to be able to carry out their responsibilities competently.] \[Being a competent citizen requires familiarity with the basics of math, natural science, social science, history, and literature, as well as the ability to read and write well and the ability to think critically.] \[A liberal education is essential to developing these skills.] Therefore, __in order for a democracy to prosper, its citizens must get a liberal education.__

> *The markings in this sample problem indicate that the last sentence*
