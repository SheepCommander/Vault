Colleges want to check three things when they read this essay.

**First, they want to see that you have a sense of what makes this college different and special.**

- Do you know something about the school's mission, history, or values?
- Have you thought about the school's specific approach to learning?
- Are you comfortable with the school's traditions and the overall feel of student life here?

**Second, they want proof that you will be a good fit for the school.**

- Where do your interests lie? Do they correspond to this school's strengths?
- Is there something about you that meshes well with some aspect of the school?
- How will you contribute to college life? How will you make your mark on campus?

**And third, they want to see that this school will, in turn, be a good fit for you.**

- What do you want to get out of college? Will this college be able to provide that? Will this school contribute to your future success?
- What will you take advantage of on campus (e.g., academic programs, volunteer or travel opportunities, internships, or student organizations)?
- Will you succeed academically? Does this school provide the right rigor and pace for your ideal learning environment?
