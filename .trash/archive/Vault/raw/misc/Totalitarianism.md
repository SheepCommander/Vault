(Based on lesson by Mr. Walters, https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tmc4UfeS3pVErPIAAjtvDXseJs0tg8JS_P9n4kK0bkM/edit?usp=sharing [his teaching style is mostly talking head, not much content on slides itwself>)

The original Totalitarian government is Fascist Italy, which was also the first Fascist country.

Mussolini came up with Fascism from "The Fasces", a weapon from Ancient Rome consisting of sticks bundled together with an axe head sticking out.
> "Each individual stick is weak, but tied together with a common cause we are strong"

He believed society should mirror the Fasces.
