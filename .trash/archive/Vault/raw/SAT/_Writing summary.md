Easiest thing to improve: Its vs it's, there their they're, affect effect, fewer vs less, your vs you're, etc.

Sentence fragments are:
- Phrases that are not full sentences. Missing a subject or a verb.
- Sentences that start with *but* or another conjunction
Run-ons are:
- Run-on sentences are two sentences jammed together `,` you need to find a way to fix them.

Fixing: Run-ons:
- Replace the comma with a `. ! ?``
- Or a semicolon `;`
- Or with a comma AND conjunction  `, and`


###### Semicolons and periods are objectively interchangeable. Their differences are subjective and thus if both is an option neither can be right on the SAT.


Colons can be used in many cases: to list examples, emphasize part of a sentence, and more!
- *colon can only be used following a full sentence. This partial sentence: isn't grammatically correct*
A dash is even more flexible--you can use it a bit like either a semicolon or a comma.
- *in this case it's like a semicolon*
**Colons and dashes are interchangeable** (except--in the case of--dashes that are used in a pair)

Appositives--**which add detail to a noun by using either commas, dashes, or parentheses**-- are not essential to a sentence.
* *note appositives can also use a period as the ending comma/dash, so they might be at the end of a sentence--like this.*


**Parallel Structure: Very important, practice on Khan Academy!**
- For centuries, cats have guarded this famous museum, ridding it of mice, rats, and other rodents that could damage the art, not to mention *scared/scaring/scare* off visitors.
	- *Take the sentence into context. Are cats scaring off visitors? No. **Mice** cause **damage**, and they also **scare** off visitors*


COMMAS can come:
- After an introductory clause, phrase, or modifier.
- Lists/Nonessential elements
	- Note: Helping to narrow down the scope is essential! If it doesn't, non-essential!
	- Oxford comma required on SAT! (The last comma in a list)



Remember your transitions:
1. Likewise, similarly, furthermore, additionally, moreover, as well as
2. Consequently, accordingly, subsequently, therefore
3. Conversely, In contrast, however, yet, nevertheless
4. For instance, for example, in particular, markedly, namely
*However is a fancier but; however, you need to put a semicolon before using it like a junction.*



#### Most "effective"/"concise" questions
- ALWAYS eliminate repetition
- ALWAYS eliminate redundancy.   *This includes ALL synonyms, do not use multiple words that mean the same thing in the same sentence*
- The more concise, and *normal*, a sentence sounds, the more right it will be. (Avoid words you don't know or wouldn't use in an essay)
- Go for the shortest answer that gets the job done


#### Ordering sentence questions
1. If you see the numbers that indicate an ordering question, read the paragraph, note if anything confusing or out of order jumps out.
2. Plug the answer choices into the paragraph to see if it makes sense.
	1. If anything is explained in-depth, MAKE SURE it is INTRODUCED **BEFOREHAND**
	2. Test every single one


#### Include or delete? questions
- Must provide helpful context **for the sentence that comes after**
- Cannot just be a vaguely related fact

In general keep in mind the actual themes and points of the paragraphs, passages, and make sure the sentences transition smoothly and make sense.
