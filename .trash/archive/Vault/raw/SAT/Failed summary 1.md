```Semicolon/Period: Separates or Joins independent clauses. Their differences are subjective so if both . and ; are options, then you can cross both of them out since the SAT is objective.

Comma:
- In a list of a, b, and c, you must always include the 'Oxford Comma' before "and".
- Used to separate nonessential elements similar to parenthesis. If you read, this sentence, and remove the part inbetween the commas, it should make sense. If it doesn't, then you are correct that the previous sentence is grammatically wrong.
- After checking that the useage of commas are grammatically correct, check if the element it separates is Essential or Non-Essential. When you need to find the "more effecitve/more concise" option on the SAT, always choose the one that removes non-essential elements. BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN THE ELEMENT HELPS TO NARROW DOWN SCOPE, IT IS IN FACT ESSENTIAL!
- Commas are also used "After an introductory clause, phrase, or modifier"

Colon:
- Can only come after an independent clause (Sentence before colon must be independent!)
- Can always be replaced by a dash, but not always vice versa. in the case of two dashes paired up.


Incomplete sentences are only acceptable if it's effective & deliberate.
Hope you already understand "Subordination and coordination"
