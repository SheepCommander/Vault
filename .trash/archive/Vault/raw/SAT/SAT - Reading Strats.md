### Strategy: Reading (65 min):
- Skim questions before each passage
	- Summary questions
	- Overarching themes
- Underline all the vocab
- Sometimes answer them before

- Read intro, can help answer summary questions (on Science or debate)
	- Here you can guess a little based on names & dates for Womens Suffrage

- Vocab question:
	- Underline term that it wants you to replace
	- Read the sentence and maybe a sentence before and after

TWO-PART CITATION QUESTIONS
- Circle each quote in the passage (differentiate questions w/ little symbols)
	- Do it during brain breaks or at beginning
- Read the Q to the first part but not the answer choices
- Now read circled quotes and eliminate unrelated ones.
	- MAKE SURE IT ANSWERS EVERY PART OF QUESTION EVEN ISOLATED
	- Both have to match
