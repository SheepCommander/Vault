I basically missed both lol

Level 1: 


Crystie 1: Closing after fall line (last third of turn)
Crystie 2: Closing before fall line (end of first third of turn?)
Parallel: full parallel

CRYSTIE GARLANDS!!!
garlands: NOT crossing fall line
- spread the butter, bring your skis back together at end of turn


CAGE: do NOT say "but" do NOT say "but" that NEGATES the compliment
"Brent I think you did a really great job closing after the fall line and spreading the butter, next you should totally try going faster and getting more comfortable with it!"

"Gracie that was a really good crystie right there, next you should try getting into more of an athletic stance to make bringing your skis together even easier!"
"Hey .... I thought you did a really good job bringing your skis parallel, I think next time you could 
"I notice that you're getting more parallel with your turns... I think one thing you could really work on is pushing your shins into your boots to get better stance and be more comfortable while you're skiing"
"I think you did a great job of bringing your skis together at the right moment, next time something we can practice a lot more is not lifting your ski because it throws off your balance and we can just work on that"

"Thanks! Also <to kid> can you show me your pass?"
