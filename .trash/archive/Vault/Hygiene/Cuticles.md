5. Keep removing shtuff
6. File natural nails with *soft* nail file
nails are actually normally square

If there's ridges, high points are natural width, the low points are the weakened width. Use fiberized ridge filler.

### Moisturizing:
Any skin moisturizer will work fine for the cuticles. When you put it on your hands and there's some left over, rub it into the cuticles.

Most dermatologists recommend thick moisturizing, i.e. ointments or creams. The American Academy of Dermatology reccs Vaseline as an inexpensive way to care for cuticles.

"Ointments are harder to wear during the day, bc they're messy," "Lotions can be used throughout the day, bc the hands dont get as greasy, but lotions aren't as moisturizing as creams and ointments."
### Avoid Drying Agents
Will dry you: dish washing or nail polish remover containing acetone.
Use vinyl gloves for dish duty and use acetone-free nail polish remover.

Good time to put the lubricant on, the gloves keep the oil on the cuticle & nail plate.
#### Keep MY HANDS out of yo MOUTH
