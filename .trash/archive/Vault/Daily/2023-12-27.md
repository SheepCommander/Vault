Started 12:42am


Ari might be dead
I'm not sure
Just got Human Resource Machine for free after checking the Vencord discord looking for a way to be notified when Ari goes online



Creating a schedule would be a good idea

1:20am Play something...
nope ive been watching youtube fuck (132)


5:14am so low I've decided to try playing Lethal w/ glassy
6:47am an okay time playing Lethal with glassy, angeless, and rey. I really wish I'd done this with ari.

7:03am I should eat that korean pear. and i should lie down but try to stay awake for misha's birthday
i was planning to gift him {{celeste}} after helping him work on mama's present and stuff i thought it would be cool fun and good for him but i dont know about myself anymore

clearing out the many YT tabs I opened earlier bc im probably depressed
I should save good touhou content to send to ari

i should pray right now 706am
y'know i could've ordered things to ari's house for her and told her she can just bullshit something about crypto and such...


I fell asleep until 520pm, or as ari prefers 17:20

luci's alive
