→*Willing to lose.* You want to lose if you're wrong. Hoping that right will prevail earns good will from the audience and shows due modesty (since it acknowledges that you could be wrong; cf. [[Humility]]) but also confidence (since you don't seem too worried about it).
> However weak our country may be, I hope we never shall sacrifice our liberties. If, therefore, on a full and candid discussion, the proposed system shall appear to have that tendency, for God's sake, let us reject it! But let us not mistake words for things, nor accept doubtful surmises as the evidence of truth.

> When have the rights of the West not been respected by gentlemen from other portions of the Union? I ask the gentleman to answer my question, for I should loathe myself if I supposed myself capable of voting for or against a bill because it was to benefit any particular section of the country. I want to put the history of the country right. I want to be rebuked if I am wrong.

> I am so sure that truth is on my side of this question that instead of being afraid I absolutely court an investigation of it. I am willing to know the truth about it. If my party cannot be sustained by the truth, then I for one say it ought not to be sustained.

→*The principle of charity.* Taking on the other side's case at its best, not its worst; addressing the problems that are hardest for you, not easiest. This is a good intellectual etiquette. It shows fearlessness and satisfies onlookers. An example from Mill:
> In order more fully to illustrate the mischief of denying a hearing to opinions because we, in our judgement, have condemned them, it will be desirable to fix down the discussion to a concrete case; and I choose, by preference, the cases which are least favorable to me—in which the argument against freedom of opinion, both on the score of truth and on that of utility, is considered the strongest.

Mill went on to talk about the most basic moral beliefs; he said they were the best cases for his antagonist because "he will be sure to say (and many who have no desire to be unfair will say it internally), Are these doctrines which you do not deem sufficiently certain to be taken under the protection of the law?" An application from debates about slavery:
> Let us now take the most favorable case for the slaveholder—say that our mortal enemy, taken in the very act of a malicious attempt upon our property, our liberty, or our life even. Surely, if we have Divine authority to enslave our fellow creature in any case, this would be the case. But no; not for a moment.

Robert Southey once said that governments are made most secure by training the public in religious observance.
