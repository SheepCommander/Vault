MARS Module 2: Active Learning

- Learners can benefit from sharing their approach out loud with the group.
- Learners can stay motivated and feel like a part of a community.
- Tutors can adjust their explanations to meet learners where they are.
- Learners can ask questions.

the biggest benefit we can provide to learners is allowing them to engage as active participants in their learning process.

# 🧑‍🏫 I do - the tutor leads problem solving
This is a technique to use when most of your learners wouldn't know where to start with the problem themselves.
- You lead the problem-solving process. As you go, ask learners simple questions to ensure they’re following along and to see if you need to adjust your explanations.
- 16 seconds "I do!" example https://youtu.be/4DvIqX0G2zI
- Check fundamental knowledge:
> "Have you all seen graphs with an axis like this before? Oh awesome, Amanda—can you share what you know about it?”
> "Are y'all already familiar with this type of distribution, or would it be helpful to get a quick refresher on that concept?"
> "Next, we want to take the least common denominator. Can anyone remind us what that means?"
- Erik takes the lead to explain the answer, but also incorporates a question https://youtu.be/3TriruTgD0Q

Ask questions!!
- “Reading through the question, which parts of the table do you think we care about most?”
- “Looking at this table, can someone tell me how many dogs are fed only dry food?”
- “Now that we have the total number of dogs with only dry food, what other number do we need to get the fraction of dogs with only dry food?”

> [!WARNING] Be careful to only use when you're sure learners need to learn something from scratch

### Make questions normal
- "Which parts of this process do you all have questions about?”
- "What are your questions?"
- “Please give me your questions! If you're confused by something, I’m sure other people on this call are also confused.”
> [!CAUTION] Wait 8-10 seconds to give learners time to process 

# 🙋 We do - the learners lead problem solving
Learners have some of the skills to solve a problem, but they aren’t ready to solve it independently.
1. Set expectations!
  - "For this next set of problems, I'll be asking you all to take the lead and share your ideas about how to answer each question. I'll be here to support and help out if you get stuck. If your ideas aren't perfectly correct, it actually just makes for a better learning experience for everyone—someone else might also have made that mistake."
  - “When we review these practice problems, you'll each take turns working through each step, and I'll help if you get stuck. If you don't know something, just try your best! We're all here to learn. Does everyone have paper, a pencil and a calculator, so you can follow along? If not, I can give you all a minute to grab it."
2. "I didn't get this one right"
  - Encourage them! https://youtu.be/OucFDg2fz4E
3. Revoice ideas to clarify them
  - “Exactly—the strawberries are proportional to the blueberries.”
  - “Yes, the library is the common theme throughout the passage.”
4. Ask their reasoning:
  - “Why do you think the passage implies that?”
  - "Exactly! Could you break down how you got there?"
  - "Why do you think option A wouldn't work?"
  - "Why should we choose the number of oranges rather than the number of crates?"

# ✍️ You do - the learners work on problems independently
Your learners have most of the skills to solve a problem, and it’s time to let them attempt problems without extra support.

# One-sentence answers?
**Prompt learners to share the reasoning behind their answer.**
"The square root, yep! Why the square root?"

**Revoice learners' ideas, using the same language they used.**
"This paragraph implies that these experts are kinda behind the times. Exactly. Where else do we see this implied?"

**Build off of learners' incorrect answers.**
"Demanding and Cruel? I can see how some of the language in paragraph two could point to that—let's look at it more closely to see if that's the best description. What other options were you considering?"
