# Boundaries - papa 1:1s
When I say I don't want to talk about it, he fully intends to respect it. 
* But sometimes he'll fail, and I should tell him
* And sometimes he may need to push a bit

Also: 
Anything I say is in confidence - except to mama. However, he'll let me know what will be out was shared so there's no guess work (what she does/doesn't know).

He will generally ask me what is on my mind and let me talk about anything. When he has something to discuss, he might lead with that, and it's okay if I don't want to talk about it. 
* But there may be times he insists we do have to talk about this, and we'll figure out a timing. 

"In confidence" includes actively avoiding "weaponizing" words against me: I'm allowed to change my mind, including changing these boundaries.
