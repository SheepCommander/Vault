# Safety
"I wish I could help you more, but unfortunately, I have to run."
You can then suggest that they share their extra questions in the help channel for the topic they're struggling with.

- "I'm not comfortable getting into all of these questions about myself. Anything else you want to cover about linear equations?"
- "Looks like something came up and I need to wrap up this session early, sorry about that!"
After your session, please let our safety team know about what happened by going to schoolhouse.world/report.


- "Looks like something came up and I need to go, sorry about that!"
- "I don't feel comfortable doing that."
- "I don't think I'm the right person to support you with this."
- "It doesn't seem appropriate for us to talk about this."
- "Sorry, but I don't have time for that right now."

Good reasons
- I want to get help with an upcoming test
- I want to make new friends from different cultures
- I want to earn volunteer hours

Bad reasons
- I want to advertise for my business
- I want someone to do my homework for me
- I want to troll sessions
- I'm an adult who wants to make friends with kids
- I want to find a romantic partner

If you suspect that someone is trolling your session, it's important to remove them from the Zoom immediately. If you give them too many chances, their behavior may escalate and become more harmful.
• Testing your limits. This could mean using bad language, interrupting you, making sudden noises, or making rude comments.
• Being rude or overly familiar with other learners. Sometimes, trolls will join in groups.
• Saying or drawing off-topic things. Trolls often refuse to focus on the session content.

# Spam
Give Nasreen a warning. For example: “Nasreen, I see you have a question and I’ll get to it soon, but it’s important that you don’t spam the chat. If you keep spamming that chat, I’ll have to remove you from the session.”

If they repeat the behavior, remove them without another warning. Note that once they are removed from the session, they can’t rejoin, and their Schoolhouse account may be temporarily suspended.

# Profanity
You should remove Lea immediately, without warning.

Apologize to the learners, and let them know you need a minute to report. You could say: “That kind of language is not okay here. I'm sorry about that. I have removed Lea and they won't be allowed back in."

# Do not interact off-platform
Lin and Karen, I love that you made such a strong connection in our session. But for safety reasons we don’t allow members to share personal information like emails or social media handles. I’ll be happy to host another session next week if you all want to continue learning together!

If they continue to share, remove the offending learner(s) from the session without another warning.

Immediately after your session, report the user. Our safety team will look into it as soon as possible and resolve the issue.

- Hey everyone, unfortunately it’s against schoolhouse.world policies to exchange personal contact info or social media
- Next, click the flag button to report the comment to us.

# Remove inappropriate disruptive
Malicious learners (who try to disrupt sessions with inappropriate behavior) are very rare, but they are a real possibility so it’s critical that all of us are prepared for that worst case.

Many of our learners are under 18 so we must be extra cautious to prevent inappropriate behavior from escalating. Even if the inappropriate behavior seems somewhat minor, remove the learner immediately and report the incident as soon as your session is over.

# Scribbling
“Mike please do not scribble on the screen. If you repeat, I will have to remove you from the session.”

If they continue, remove
Immediately after your session, report the user. Our safety team will look into it as soon as possible and resolve the issue.

# Inappropriate drawing
Remove Adam immediately, without warning.
Apologize to the learners, and let them know you removed the learner. You could say: “That was really inappropriate. I'm so sorry about that. I have removed Adam and they won't be allowed back in."
After your session, be sure to report the user.

# Slur
death

# Screen sharing inappropriate images
"stop sharing", remove,  apology, report

# End Meeting For All
Trang, I understand that you have a question and Yusuf would like to answer, but unfortunately cannot leave the two of you without supervision and so I'll have to end the meeting. Maybe you can take it on our session’s discussion forum (link the session) and we could continue this in our next session which will be on this same topic?"

# Home country/state
allowed + Grade #, but NOT ANY contact

# Beginning of session
Do not warn all learners at the beginning of a session. You should try to be positive in setting expectations at the beginning of the session. Explain how learners should act, not what actions will result in removal.
