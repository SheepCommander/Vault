Text Chat!

**Name: Am I pronouncing that correctly? Thanks, just wanted to make sure**

a. When a learner joins your session, they'll look for cues to figure out whether it's a space where they can let their guard down.
- Did the tutor smile when they greeted me?
- Did the tutor refer to be by my name?
- Does the tutor look glad to be here?
- How casual is the tutor's body language and tone?
- How are other learners engaging?
- Does the tutor think what I'm struggling with is easy?

1) Set a casual tone
- Use friendly, relaxed body language. Sit back in your chair and relax. Take the initiative to smile.
- Make small talk during down-time. As you wait for the session to start, ask a learner how their day was, what they did over the weekend, etc. Avoid overly formal language.
- Slow down your speaking, and don't be afraid of silence. It’s easy to start talking fast when you’re nervous—take a deep breath and allow for pauses in the conversation.
2) Normalize struggling
- It's easy for learners to assume they don't have the capacity to learn something, especially when they don't see anyone else struggling with it the way they are.
- To help them get rid of this misconception, don't be afraid to talk about how you found concepts challenging at first.
- “Honestly, despite doing well on the reading section, I still find it difficult—it doesn't need to feel easy for you to do well. The best way to build your comfort level is through a bunch of practice.”
- “Does anyone have questions about that? I know scatterplots can be kinda confusing to read.”
- Avoid considering any topic easy.
3) Turn mistakes into learning opportunities
- The secret is: don't (explicitly) tell them they made a mistake!
- Instead, jump into figuring out what they did do right, helping them identify where they went wrong, and guiding them to the right answer.
- "Why don't you tell us the first thing we notice about the angles.." "Oh why do you think they add up to 180?" "Well I can see why youd think that"
