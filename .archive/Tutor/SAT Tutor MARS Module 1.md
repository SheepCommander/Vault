Reviewing the practice test before your session.

- **What pre-requisite knowledge do learners need to solve this problem?** How will I check for that?
- **How will I engage learners to solve this problem?** If they're struggling, how will I explain the core concepts behind it?

Goal #1: Build your learners' content knowledge as you review SAT practice problems.

Goal #2: Teach your learners helpful and relevant test-taking skills.

As you go through each question, it's important to highlight how to choose an effective strategy for approaching the question—especially in cases where they're less confident about the material being covered.

_Think about the last time you took this test. What's a strategy you used when approaching questions you were less comfortable with?_

• It's better to guess vs. leave questions blank (no points off for wrong answers).
• If you don't know how to do a question, skip it and come back to it later.
• Use process of elimination.
• Provide any other testing tips you might have!

In addition to sharing specific strategies with learners, help them work through any test-anxiety they may be facing.

You can do this by validating that preparing for this test was challenging for you too, and that their score doesn't define them or their career.

Imagine: it's getting close to test day, and you ask learners how they're feeling. One learner says they always get nervous during tests and so they're pretty sure they're going to freak out the day of.

"It's honestly totally normal to feel that way—test-taking can be stressful. Just remember that your score on the SAT doesn't define you; it's only one part of the college application process, and the college application is only one part of what you choose to do with your career, and what you choose to do with your career is one part of what you do with your life. Doing well on the SAT is great, but it's just one opportunity for success amongst all the other things you'll work on in your life."


"I feel you! I honestly felt that way before the test, too, but I think that's actually super normal. Just remember: it's okay if some problems show up out of the blue and make zero sense—all you have to do is focus your time on the problems that you feel you have a good shot at, and do the best you can."

# But wait... what if I run into a question I don't know how to answer?
It's okay! Let them know that you'll get back to them after the session. Once you find the answer, you can share it through your bootcamp's group chat.
