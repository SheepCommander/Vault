# Peer Tutoring Self-Directed Training
This "quiz" is less about right and wrong, and more about mental preparation for tutoring.

We have all needed help at some time, either with academics or other.  Please share an example of a time when someone helped you learn to do something.  What made it go well?
> First of all, I always needed to clarify and identify what they're struggling with. I need to check and confirm any assumptions their initial question may lead me to as beginners rarely know what they don't know, and often won't communicate in a way that an experienced person is used to expecting.
> After confirming exactly what they need and in the process getting a general idea of where they're at, it tends to become exponentially easier to help them through the problem!
> But, sometimes the communication mismatch can be so bad I still don't know what they need or despite using beginner-friendly language they still don't get it, the best course of action is usually either to have a second person connect with them or to have the student take the lead and accomodate them while they do their best to show you what they're working on.

Rank these in order of importance in your own mind as a tutor.[^1]
> 1. The student works through a problem or task themselves, with encouragement.
> 2. You learn a little bit about the student.
> 3. Together, you identify a clear topic to work on.
> 4. The student shows you what they have been working on in class.

For your top-ranked item, explain why you chose that as most important.
> As a tutor, I really want to see students learn how to work through a problem by themselves so they can do it in the future without help. But as person-to-person, I would actually put "Learn a little bit about the student" as number one as I love to meet interesting people.

What concerns, if any, do you have about tutoring?
> There's the concern of wanting to be able to help any student who comes to me and making sure they leave having been helped in one way, but I've had extensive experience helping beginners through computer science topics and I believe I'm overprepared in this aspect and ready to tutor anyone.

[^1]: Apparently this has a correct answer in the context of NHS and it is:
  1- You learn a little bit about the student
  2- The student shows you what they have been working on in class.
  3- Together, you identify a clear topic to work on.
  4- The student works through a problem or task themselves, with encouragement.
