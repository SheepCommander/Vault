1. **Importance of the First Session:** Set the tone for the four weeks ahead
2. **Start of Every Session:** Linger on the icebreaker, ask follow-up questions, encourage learners to talk to one another, not just to you.
3. **Throughout every session,** smth idk

My learners are only talking in chat, not verbally.
**"Ask the student to solve the question on the board, while explaining it at the same time."**

"I taught a good lesson even though the students didn't learn it."
WRONG

# Language matters
NOT "any questions" do "What are your questions?"

NOT "looks like u got this right" do "Could you share how you approached this one?"
