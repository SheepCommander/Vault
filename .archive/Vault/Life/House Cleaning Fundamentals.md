# Counters
Spray Bottle: Filled w/ 70% strength Isopropyl Alcohol + 2 drops dish soap
Two rags, any rag (shirt too) works.
- Warm water rag + Tiny amount of dish soap
	- Until its damp & some sud but not crazy foam
1. Scrub w/ it to get grime off!
2. Then dry off with other rag
3. THEN sanitize w/ alcohol spray
4. Wait 30 seconds then Wipe down!

# Toilet 1
Toilet cleaner, gloves, squeeze. Just make sure it coats the sides then it's fine.
- "Do first to let it sit for a long time."

# Windows
Cheap: Just same way as the countertop! Wet rag + Dry rag.

Expensive: Alcohol spray, microfiber rag, ultrafine microfiber rag
- Quickly spray with alcohol
- Wipe off with microfiber
- Dry off with ultrafine microfiber

# Mirror
*Sanitizer spray is also a good shiner*
- Spray mirror
- Wipe down - it'll be damp with the cleaner!
- Dry off

# Sink
Alternate options
- [ ] Emulsifier like our dish soap thing / Mr. Clean ("more powerful")
- [ ] Bar Keeper's Friend (cheap & powerful)
Spray with Mr. Clean
Use rough "scouring" side of sponge all around sink & faucet
Take dry cloth & dry it all off (spray doesnt actually leave a residue, so dont need to rinse)
### Grimy hard water stains
ignore lol


# Bathtub
Scouring agent (Bar Keeper's Friend - powder form)
1. Wet down bath tub, just slightly wet whatev not scrubbing anything else
2. Sprinkle scouring agent around
3. DO NOT let it sit, meybe use gloves bc it stings cuts,
4. Immediately start scrubbing it with Rough scouring side of sponge
	- Scrubbing in small circles may help
5. Rinse things down!
6. Spray with sanitizing spray (help rinse & wipe down residue from scouring agent)
7. Finish wiping down with rag

# Dusting
You don't need ANYTHING, just use a dry cloth to fling it onto the floor.

Or, use a Swiffer Duster that actually holds onto dust!
*Go from Top to Bottom btw*

# Vacuum
What setting do I put it on? In some case it doesn't mean Engine strength, it means distance of bristles from floor.

Poofy stringy bean carpet: High
Slightly poofy carpet: Medium
Carpet or hardwood floor: Low
- Clean out tangled bristles w/ scissors & hands
- Take out filter & bang it on the ground outside (Some of them can be ran with Hot Water)

# Toilet 2
**Gloves**. Scrubbing wiping down. Use (except inside bowl) Mr. Clean or Dish Soap thing.
- Spray from top to bottom: Lid & top of toilet, Seat, underneath Seat, then surrounding floor (sides & front).
- Use toilet paper. Reverse order: start with all seats up, then put them down one at a time. Wipe down toilet seats.
- Get more toilet paper for the very top. Then sides of toilet & floor.

#### Toilet Scrubber
Use Toilet Scrubber to brush up underneath the lip of the toilet.

Let sit for an hour or two hours.

### Washing rags
Use normal detergent on hot. Don't use Fabric Softener.

# Cleaning pans
NEVER put lots of grease down the sink. It resolidifies as soon as it enters the pipes and messing up your plumbing.

Put into trash, use toilet paper, then everything left will be residual. Residual is fine to put down the sink.
