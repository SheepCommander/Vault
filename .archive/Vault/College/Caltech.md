### Caltech transfer - Community College 
The courses for which transfer applicants will receive credit, and the corresponding class standing, will be determined at the time of enrollment. The transfer applicant will submit course descriptions, syllabi, and final transcripts to the Registrar who will present the material to the faculty for evaluation.

Faculty members review each course submitted for credit on an individual basis. It is sometimes not possible, therefore, to answer questions regarding the acceptability of course work taken elsewhere. Before the student is admitted, transfer students will work through Admissions to obtain a pre-evaluation estimate. If the standard of work taken elsewhere is uncertain, additional examinations may be required before the question of credit is finally determined.

### Caltech transfer - AP
College credit for AP or IB classes is not automatic. Course credit and/or placement in an accelerated program is sometimes granted as deemed appropriate by the department faculty.
The awarding of Caltech course credit takes place at the time of registration each fall.
