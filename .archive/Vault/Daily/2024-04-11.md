Ari~

I did stuff today

I schizo'd last night

I missed school today bc overslept

I woke up at maximum stress bc i heard sounds from downstairs and instinctively knew

I loafed in my bed for a full hour and a half before coming downstairs

I did one page of Precalc and I cleaned up the house and my bedroom and bathroom and ran the "dirtiest" laundry load

Oh wait I should move that to the dryer now tabun

HELLDIVAERS

I need to take notes on a web seminar abt oijwipoejawofwa abt internships

I did piano, the full Suzuki4 - 1 song + UN OWEN
I'm pretty good at piano ehe but not as good as the ppl on youtube

I need to get internships btw but apparently most of the FAANG ones only have like 4 spots and 15,000+ applicants
