Really good sermon today by pastor scotty

Read First John (1 John) it takes abt 30 minutes

we focused on how, if we have 1 commandment, is it to love God *and* our neighbors

murder = evil, no eternal life, Cain
hating someone = murder
looking at the unfortunate and ur heart not breaking = how can u be a follower of god
loving someone = do as Jesus has done, lay down your life for ur brothers & sisters



So i should ask Mama to help me with JP stuff for ARI!!!
