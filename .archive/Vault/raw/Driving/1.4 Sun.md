Treat it like a 4-way stop sign

You yield to EVERYONE

**Legal Stop:** Stop before a stop line, crosswalk, or sidewalk

‚≠êüåü#39: At a red light, always stop **behind the stop line first**

Stop at stop line, then scoot up until curb line to make sure its clear

Staggered stop: **15 feet** (one car length) from the stop line

A staggered stop happens to create space for buses, semi-trucks, & ppl cutting yellow lines


STOP BEHIND ANOTHER VEHICLE W/ ENOUGH DISTANCE TO SEE THEIR REAR WHEELS OVER UR HOOD
^ avoid exhaust fumes, make sure u can see around their butt, to give room, incase of slippery,
