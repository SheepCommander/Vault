- Always objective. Try to look for what's DIRECTLY stated in the passage.
- Skim questions before each passage really quick
- READ THE INTRO & TITLE, IT HELPS WITH SUMMARY QUESTIONS

- Underline vocab word, read it and get a general idea BEFORE looking at the choices

For two-part citation questions:
1. Read the question but not the answer choices
2. Circle the citation lines
3. Read circled lines and make sure it answers EVERY part of the question
4. "What's Katz attitude towards 'today's digital technologies"
	1. We're looking for both some opinion from Katz
	2. And it has to be about modern technology
		1. *this one is just describing how he's done some research & stuff, also talks about 1800s*
		2. *this one is more on the mark but doesn't state anything about new tech directly*
		3. "People always come up with new thing to do" *too general*
		4. "If technology disrupts enough, who knows what'll happen?" *mentions technology in the present tense and questions what will happen*
5. Now make sure one of them works
