### Grammar
Schoolhouse rock to rember basics

It is   |   Its
Effect (noun)   |   Affect(s) (verb)
- *good grammar can affect a passage positively, giving it a more powerful effect overall*
Fewer: for countable things (Fewer sentences)
Less: for things that are more abstract (Less goofy)


Sentence fragments: not full sentences. Missing subject or verb.
Ex: Sentences that start with "but" or another conjunction \[ARE(verb) FRAGMENTS].

Run-on sentences: two full sentences pasted together without right punctuation.
1. Period, exclamation point, etc.
2. Semicolon: Keeps them in the same sentence, but should be __substitutable with a period__
3. Comma WITH conjunction after it (and so)
	1. If just a comma between two full sentences, you need to replace with a ; . or add an "and"
4. Colons & dashes are interchangeable, but colon is a lot of emphasis while dash more flexible. Both are closer to commas than semicolons, so a full sentence doesn't need to follow.
	1. *A colon can be used in many cases: to list examples, emphasize part of a sentence, and more!*
	2. *A dash is even more flexible-- you can use it a bit like either a semicolon or a comma.*
5. "Appositive": A detail surrounded by commas or dashes that give extra detail CAN BE TAKEN OUT AND STILL BE GRAMMATICALLY CORRECT (also the surrounding punctuations have to match each other)


Parallel Structure:
- When there's a list of something, the different parts of the sentence should match!
	- *My mom likes cooking, going on walks, and **watching** shows on Netflix.*
	- *For centuries, cats have guarded this famous museum, ridding it of **mice**, rats, and other rodents that could **damage** the art, not to mention scared/scaring/**scare** off the visitors*
	- ^ Take the time to comprehend all sentences

Word bank:
- Likewise, Similarly; Furthermore, Additionally, Moreover; As well as
- Consequently, Accordingly, Subsequently, Therefore
- Nevertheless, Despite the odds; Conversely, In contrast, However, Yet
- For instance, For example, In particular, Markedly, Namely
Read the two choices you're trying to connect

Note:
However is a fancier but; however, you need to put a semicolon before using it like a conjunction.

### Repetition
Rule-of-thumb: Always pick the shortest and most normal-sounding answer if in doubt.
"The great annual fall harvest, which happened yearly" - REDUNDANT

- Oftentimes the most concise will be the correct
- The pattern Box observed in 2012 **may** *repeat* itself *again*, with [harmful effects]
		- NO CHANGE
		- itself,             <---
		- itself, with [damage] and
		- itself **possibly**


Avoid words or phrases that..
- Sound too casual    (things, stuff, slang, everyday)
- Sound too formal, don't even know definition      (opine, neophyte, fortitude, geriatric)
- Wouldn't use in an essay      (Some answers may sound cool or poetic, but these are pretty bland passages so **TONE AND LANGUAGE SHOULD MATCH**)  (plug in each in your head)
- Also avoid cliches or idioms in answer choices

But *more pragmatically,* the discipline encourages students to analyze complex...
1. NO CHANGE            <---
2. *speaking in a more pragmatic way,*
3. speaking in a way more pragmatically,
4. *in a more pragmatic-speaking way,*


MOST EFFECTIVE =
- **Prevents repetition**
- **Does it in the smoothest way**
*Also, studies have found that those students who major in philosophy often do better than students from other majors in both verbal reasoning and analytical **writing. These results can be** measured by standardized test scores*
1. writing as     <---
2. writing, and these results can be
3. writing, which can also be
4. writing when the results are


ORDERING SENTENCES
1. Read, notice if anything confusing or out of order jumps out, esp. if you see the numbers indicating an ordering question
2. Take best guess
3. Read paragraph in order you're about to choose.
	1. Make sure all content is *introduced* before the in-depth talk


Include or Delete
To add something:
- Must provide helpful context to the sentence that comes after
- Can't just be a vaguely related fact
- Keep in mind the sentences before & after, make sure it flows and is relevant
