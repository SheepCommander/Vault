GO FAST LOL
To find standard deviation:
- Subtract the mean from each of the datapoints
- Square the result
- Add them all up

Circle:
$$(x - h)^2 + (x - k)^2 = r^2$$

SohCahToa is relative to the angle that you feed into the equation

$$(u^2 - t^2) = (u+t)(u-t)$$


"H = 1.88L + 32.01"
What's meaning of 1.88?
**+1 L = +1.88 H**

STRAIGHT LINE
if it only crosses parabola once, it must be the vertex
y = f(-b/2a)


d = r * t
r = d / t
t = d / r
