School: Were u productive?
yea, somewhat.. i did the easy PE stuff it's so fun I'm a full month ahead,,
but i got 1/2 on AP Phys bc i didn't realize that the train stops exerting acceleration on the ball as soon as it leaves the person's hands, so if the train was at 10m/s and the ball moving backwards at 4m/s in the air, even tho the train is accelerating it doesn't change the balls velocity of 6m/s relative to the ground. FUCK.
I'm so cooked for AP Lang and i apparently need to step up in AP Phys
**Notes:**
Apparently i need to STUDY AHEAD in ap phys because Fischer only teaches you enough to get a 3..
