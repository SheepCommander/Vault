The four of us + Laia (& Joesep, E. Kelly's kids) went to the Efteling water park!!

It was actually really fun. I walked in and thought "Oh wait. This amusement park is actually stacked. Damn."

Fast carts, upside down, loop-the-loop, etc.!

Anyways, I think the watershow @ 10:15pm was worth it. I think the Mad House was incredibly fun with the muslim girls behind us screaming all the time. It really made my brain think that we were actually going upside down. The Mad House was genuinely fun.
