1. Substantial health benefits for adults
occur with 150 to 300 minutes a week of
moderate-intensity physical activity, such
as brisk walking. Additional benefits occur
with more physical activity.

2. During aerobic activity (also called an endurance
exercise or cardio), the body’s large muscles move in a
rhythmic manner for a sustained period of time. Brisk walking,
running, bicycling, jumping rope, and swimming are all
examples. 

3. While doing an aerobic activity, a person’s heart will beat faster, and they will breathe harder than normal.

4. Aerobic physical activity has three components:
• Intensity, or how hard a person works to do the activity. The intensities most often studied are
moderate (equivalent in effort to brisk walking) and vigorous (equivalent in effort to running or jogging);
• Frequency, or how often a person does aerobic activity; and
• Duration, or how long a person does an activity in any one session.

5. Muscle-Strengthening activity, which includes resistance training and weight lifting, causes the body’s muscles to work
or hold against an applied force or weight. These activities often involve lifting relatively heavy objects, such as
weights, multiple times to strengthen various muscle groups. Muscle-strengthening activity can also be done
by using elastic bands or body weight for resistance (climbing a tree or doing push-ups, for example).

7. Bone-strengthening activity (sometimes called weight-bearing or weight-loading activity) produces a force on the
bones of the body that promotes bone growth and strength. 

8. Some benefits of physical activity can be achieved
immediately, such as reduced feelings of anxiety, reduced blood pressure, and improvements in sleep, some
aspects of cognitive function, and insulin sensitivity. Other benefits, such as increased cardio fitness,
increased muscular strength, decreases in depressive symptoms, and sustained reduction in blood pressure,
require a few weeks or months of participation in physical activity.

9. Physical activity can slow or delay the progression of hypertension and type 2 diabetes.

10. Some benefits of exercise can include improved sleep and a lower risk for developing many forms of cancer. 

11. The following are benefits of exercise:

• Slowed or reduced weight gain
• Weight loss, particularly when combined with reduced calorie intake
• Prevention of weight regain following initial weight loss

12. HIIT is a form of interval training that consists of alternating short periods of maximal-effort exercise with less intense recovery periods.

13. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) can improve insulin sensitivity, blood pressure, and body composition in adults. 

14. Physical activity and caloric intake both must be considered when trying to control body weight.

15. Some of the benefts of physical activity on brain health occur
immediately after a session of moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity (acute effect), such as reduced feelings of state anxiety
(short-term anxiety), improved sleep, and improved aspects
of cognitive function.

17. Physically active adults and older adults are likely to report having a better quality of life. Being physically active also improves the sense of a better quality of life among people who have schizophrenia and related disorders.

18. Anxiety and anxiety disorders are the most prevalent mental disorders. Participating in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity over longer duration (weeks or months of regular physical activity) reduces symptoms of anxiety in adults and older adults.

19. Major depression is one of the most common mental disorders in the United States. Engaging in regular physical activity reduces the risk of developing depression in children and adults and can improve many of the symptoms experienced by people with depression.

20. In addition to feeling better, adults who are more physically active sleep better. Greater volumes of moderate to-vigorous physical activity are associated with reduced sleep latency (taking less time to fall asleep), improved sleep efficiency (higher percentage of time in bed actually sleeping), improved sleep quality, and more deep sleep.
Greater volumes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are also associated with significantly less daytime sleepiness, better sleep quality, and reduced frequency of use of sleep-aid medications. The improvements in sleep with regular physical activity are also reported by people with insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea.

1. Adults who are more physically active are better able to perform everyday tasks without undue fatigue.
2. Increased amounts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity are associated with improved cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, including a healthier body weight and body composition.
3. Adults who are more physically active can more easily carry out daily tasks like climbing stairs, carrying heavy packages, and performing household chores.
4. Adults should move more and sit less throughout the day.
5. Some physical activity is better than none.
6. A person who does 300 minutes a week has an even lower risk of heart disease or type 2 diabetes than a person who does 150 minutes a week.
7. People who sit a lot have an increased risk of all-cause and
cardiovascular disease mortality, as well as an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and colon, endometrial, and lung cancers. 
8. Aerobic physical activity preferably should be spread throughout the week.
9. Spreading physical activity across at least 3 days a week may also help reduce the risk of injury and prevent excessive fatigue.
10. The following are generally considered ________ intensity activities: VIGOROUS
• Jogging or running
• Swimming laps
• Tennis (singles)
• Bicycling faster than 10 miles per hour
• Jumping rope
• Heavy yard work (digging or shoveling, with heart rate increases)
• Hiking uphill or with a heavy backpack
• High-intensity interval training (HIIT)
• Exercise classes like vigorous step aerobics or kickboxing 
11. As a rule of thumb, a person doing moderate-intensity aerobic activity can talk, but not sing, during the activity.
A person doing vigorous-intensity activity cannot say more than a few words without pausing for a breath.
12. When resistance training is used to enhance muscle strength, one set of 8 to 12 repetitions of each exercise is effective, although 2 or 3 sets may be more effective.
13. While flexibility is an important part of physical fitness, time spent doing flexibility activities by themselves usually does not count toward meeting the aerobic or muscle-strengthening key guidelines (unless it is a vigorous form of yoga).
14. Walking briskly is a good warm-up before jogging.
15. Active choices, such as taking the stairs rather than the elevator or adding short episodes of walking to the day, are examples of activities that can be helpful in weight control.
